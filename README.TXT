It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

Q25: Renaming getBalance to getAmount, the return statement does not change.
Q26: added getTotal() method to return total. Tested by inserting moeny and printing.
Q27: Removing the return statement fro getPrice() causes an error, showing that the accessor methods must return a value.
Q28: getPrice() is an accessor method that returns a value and printTicket() changes the object's state and doesnt return a value.
Q29: insertMoney() and printTicket() do not have any return statements. They only modify the object's statement.
Q30: Calling insterMoney() changes the balance field, so the output of getBalance() is updated.
